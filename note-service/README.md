### Spring boot Microservice with Domain Driven Design.

Service will allow a author to do simple CRUD operations on his notes.

#### Layers

######Domain layer:

In this domain we need only to have author's identity and name.
For repository implementation I used JPA and did mapping directly on domain entities
 I know this is not a good practice , but because of time limitations I can't to better. (Sorry for that.)
